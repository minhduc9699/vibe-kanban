Vibe Kanban allows you to import tasks from external plans generated by other tools or defined in JSON format. This feature streamlines the process of converting project plans into actionable tasks on your kanban board.

## How it Works

The plan importer scans your project's `plans/` directory for valid plan files. It uses a Node.js scanner script (`scripts/plan-scanner-json.cjs`) located in your project to parse these files and convert them into Vibe Kanban tasks.

### Prerequisites

For the import to work, your project must have:

1. A `plans/` directory containing your plan files.
2. A scanner script at `scripts/plan-scanner-json.cjs` that outputs the plans in the expected JSON format.
3. Node.js installed in the environment where Vibe Kanban is running.

### Plan Format

Plans are expected to be in a format that the scanner script can process. Typically, this involves metadata about the plan, such as:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the plan
- **Name/Title**: The name of the plan or task
- **Description**: Detailed description of the work
- **Status**: Current status of the plan (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed)
- **Phases/Progress**: Information about the plan's progress

### Status Mapping

When importing plans, the status is automatically mapped to Vibe Kanban task columns:

| Plan Status | Vibe Kanban Column |
|-------------|-------------------|
| `pending` | To Do |
| `in-progress` | In Progress |
| `completed` | Done |
| `cancelled` | Cancelled (archived) |

## Importing Plans

To import plans into your project:

1. Ensure your plans are located in the `plans/` directory of your project root.
2. Use the import functionality in the Vibe Kanban interface (usually accessible via API or specialized UI controls).
3. The system will scan the directory and create tasks for each valid plan found.

<Note>
The import process spawns a secure Node.js process to scan your plans. This process has a 30-second timeout to ensure performance.
</Note>

## Executing Imported Tasks

When you start a task derived from an imported plan, Vibe Kanban automatically detects the source plan file. The **Custom prompt** field will be pre-filled with a directive to implement the specific plan file (e.g., `Implement the plan in plans/my-feature.md`), ensuring the agent works directly from your detailed plan requirements.

## API Usage

You can also trigger the import programmatically via the API:

```bash
POST /api/plans/import
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "project_id": "your-project-uuid",
  "plan_ids": ["optional-specific-plan-id"]
}
```

This is useful for integrating Vibe Kanban into larger automation workflows where plans are generated dynamically.
